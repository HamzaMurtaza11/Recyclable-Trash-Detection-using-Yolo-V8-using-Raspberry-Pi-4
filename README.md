# Recyclable-Trash-Detection-using-Yolo-V8-using-Raspberry-Pi-4

Project description.

Embedded AI project dealing with Yolo V8 Pytorch Ultralytics Nano custom object detection computer vision model, Raspberry Pi4, Raspbian OS bullseye and Picamera. The scope and goal revolves around creation of a custom nano model that detects recyclable and non-recyclable objects (plastics, non-plastics, cardboard, cloth) from a real time camera and make it compatible to run with Raspberry Pi4 with good acceleration, confidence level and optimization.
